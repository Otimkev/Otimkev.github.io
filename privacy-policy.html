                    You may elect to use information from the Linked Network to populate your profile on the Olsela

                    Provider your login information and other user data for payment purposes.

                    choices:
                  </p>
                  <h5>Followers</h5>
                  <p>
                    You can block the ability of another Olsela user to follow you by selecting the setting for this in
                    the other user’s profile. You can change whether or not you follow other users.
                  </p>
                  <h5>Topic and Spaces</h5>
                  <p>
                    You can change topics and Spaces that you are affiliated within your profile.
                  </p>
                  <h5>Credentials</h5>
                  <p>
                    You can change your credentials that are displayed in your profile or in connection with a specific
                    answer.
                  </p>
                  <h5>Deleted or Deactivated Account. </h5>
                  <p>
                    If you choose “Delete Account” in your profile’s “Privacy Settings,” then all of your content will
                    be removed from public visibility on the Olsela Platform, and it may not be restored by us, even if
                    you change your mind. If you choose “Deactivate Account,” then you will no longer receive any
                    communications from us, and users will not be able to interact with you; however your content will
                    remain on the Olsela Platform. Once you deactivate your account, you can reactivate it any time by
                    choosing to log in.

                  </h5>
                  <p>
                    You may edit or delete the answers that you post at any time. Any stories you have posted may remain
                    on the Olsela Platform and be edited by other users. Any deleted content will be removed from
                    third-party sites from which it has been shared via Olsela’s standard sharing features; however we
                    have no control over deletions or changes to your content if it has been shared manually by others.
                    When you make edits to your content, other users will be able to see the history of those edits in
                    your profile activity and on content edit logs.
                  </p>

                  <p>
                    When you join the Olsela Platform by signing up for an account or creating a profile, as part of the
                    service, you will receive email digests containing content from the Olsela Platform that we believe
                    may match your interests. As permitted by law, you are also opting to receive notices, including by
                    emails and text messages, about other content from the Olsela Platform that may be of interest to
                    you, such as Spaces that you follow or that match your interests. In addition, users may be able to
                    send communications and invites to their imported contacts through their Olsela account, by email,
                    text, or phone. You can manage all your email, text messages, and notice preferences in your account
                    profile settings, under your Emails and Notifications settings, but note that you cannot opt out of
                    receiving certain administrative or legal notices from us. If you opt out of receiving emails or
                    other notifications about recommendations or other information we think may interest you, we may
                    still send you transactional emails and text messages about your account or any services you have
                    requested or received from us.
